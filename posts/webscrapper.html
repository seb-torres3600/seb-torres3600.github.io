      <h3 id="what-web-scrapper-does">What it does?</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is exactly what the title implies. It is a web scrapper for the Zillow website. This
        project was created as part of a larger project for my Data Mining class first semester senior year. The overall
        project was intended to find patterns regarding crime vs social economic status. The best way we found was to use
        house prices in our target neighborhoods as they were a representation of income in those neighborhoods. That is
        where this project came in, we needed to get our data first, I created a web scrapper that got houses for sale in
        the Denver area, we pulled address, neighborhood, and the current price of the house. What we also needed was historical
        data, I managed to pull Zillow estimates for the houses throughout the years.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-i-built-zillow-scrapper-with">What is it built with?</h3>
      <p>
        This scrapper was built in Python, with the requests package, and selenium with the firefox option.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-zillow-scrapper-works">How it works?</h3>
      <p>
        <br>The first step was to get a list of Zillow website urls that represent about 50 houses each.</br>
        <br>The second step is to get the html code for each of those urls and add relevant information to a csv file.</br>
        <br>The third step is grabbing the individual url for the specific houses to get more specific information on them.</br>
        <br>All this data is added to a csv file that we later processed and refined.</br>
